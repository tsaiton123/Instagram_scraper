# Web Scraper Script

## Overview

This Python script is designed to perform web scraping tasks. It extracts data from a specified website or set of websites and processes it according to the parameters defined within the script. The extracted data can be saved to a local file, such as a CSV or JSON, or used for further analysis.

## Features

- **URL Input**: Define the target URLs from which data will be scraped.
- **Data Extraction**: Extract specific HTML elements (e.g., text, images, links) using BeautifulSoup or other scraping libraries.
- **Data Storage**: Save the extracted data to a CSV or JSON file.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for common web scraping issues (e.g., timeouts, connection errors).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `pandas` (if saving to CSV/JSON)
  - `lxml` (for parsing HTML/XML, if needed)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Set the target URLs**:
   - Modify the `urls` list in the script to include the URLs you want to scrape.

2. **Define the extraction logic**:
   - Customize the section of the script where data is extracted using BeautifulSoup. Specify which HTML elements to extract.

3. **Run the script**:
   - Execute the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

4. **Output**:
   - The extracted data will be saved to a file in the specified format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to modify the script to extract the titles of articles from a blog:

```python
urls = ['https://example-blog.com']

for url in urls:
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    titles = soup.find_all('h2', class_='post-title')
    
    for title in titles:
        print(title.get_text())
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the website you are scraping allows web scraping by reviewing its `robots.txt` file.
- Consider adding delays between requests to avoid overloading the server (`time.sleep()`).
- For complex websites, you might need to handle JavaScript content using `Selenium` or similar tools.
